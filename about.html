                  <h3>XR Enthusiast</h3>
                  <p>Certified and recognized by SV.CO (Startup Village Collective) as India's top 10 VR developers in collaboration with SoI (School of Innovation) by Facebook. 
                    SV.CO selected me among 1000+ team submissions and trained me for 6 months to develop a VR application for Oculus GO.</p>
                  <h3>Breath-taking Experiences</h3>
                  <p>I worked as an intern for two months in Detect Technologies, Chennai, playing a crucial role in XR development that included creating apps for both iOS and Android platform. 
                    Adding to the awesomeness, was able to grab the opportunity to work as project trainee in ISRO, where I had to create Mathematical Simulations based on user provided input. 
                    It mostly involved creating a satellite simulation and figuring out the Area of Interest at a given time.
                  <h3>Industry's Best</h3>
                  <p>
                    Superbolter, a stealth Bengaluru start-up which is aiming to ease the interior designing industry using a web-based solution, a company of such high visions, gave me a chance to prove my capability in 3D rendering and simulations. 
                    I interned and then was able to continue there as a full timer as well, giving me a plethora of opportunities to work in different platforms, understand shortcomings of Web based 3D solution and optimize them accordingly.</p>
                    <h3>Gen-Z is the way!</h3>
                    <p>
                      Was able to step-up several notches, by joining PlayShifu, which is a toy designing company at its core. They had some amazingly interesting products such as Tacto, Orboot and Plugo. 
                      I am glad I had the opportunity to work in Tacto and was able to manage releases in European and Eastern countries.
                      Adding to the excitement, the company announced an internal project that aimed at creating a safe digital eco-system for the Gen-Z, which enabled me to work on multiplayer, 
                      cross-platform applications which also includes my personal favourite Virtual Reality!</p>
